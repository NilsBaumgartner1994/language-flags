Main idea.

use the iso code of the language e.g. en-UK or en-US

every char in the alphabet has a unique color.

get the colors for the iso code accordingly.

create a round ring where the color from outside goes to inside like the iso code goes from left to right.
this way even languages like LTR or RTL can read the color code the same way.
