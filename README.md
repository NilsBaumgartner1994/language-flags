## 📝 Overview

**Language Flags** visualizes ISO language codes (e.g., `en-UK`, `en-US`) as **hexagonal flags** using unique colors for each character. This provides an accessible, language-agnostic format for both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) languages. Plus, hexagons fit together perfectly, allowing for visually pleasing, gap-free arrangements when displayed as a group.

## 🐝 Why Hexagons?

As CGP Grey says, ["Hexagons are the bestagons."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY)

Hexagons are not just visually appealing; they are also **incredibly practical**:
- **Perfect Tiling**: Hexagons fit together without gaps, ideal for arranging flags in a wall or grid.
- **Efficient Use of Space**: Hexagons offer a compact yet readable design for language codes.

## 🚩 Why ISO Codes Over Country Flags?

Using national flags for languages is problematic due to:
- **❓ Ambiguity**: Shared languages (e.g., English in the US and UK).
- **🌎 Multilingual Countries**: Nations like Canada and Switzerland have multiple languages.
- **⚡ Cultural Sensitivity**: Flags may misrepresent or exclude regional nuances.

**Language Flags** avoids these issues by focusing on ISO language codes, offering a clear, inclusive representation.

## ✨ Key Features

- **ISO Code Visualization**: Represents each character with distinct colors.
- **Hexagonal Design**: Characters are visualized as concentric hexagonal rings, starting from the outermost ring.
- **Bidirectional Readability**: Logical design for LTR and RTL languages.
- **Gap-Free Tiling**: Hexagons can be seamlessly arranged into a wall or grid without leaving any spaces.
- **Output Formats**: Supports PNG and scalable SVG files.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 🎨 Character to Color Mapping
- Each character corresponds to a **unique hue**.
- Alternating saturation and lightness enhance differentiation.

### 🔄 Hexagonal Ring Structure
- **Outer rings** represent the first character, with subsequent characters moving inward.

### 🖼️ Output Formats
- **📸 PNG**: High-quality raster images.
- **📐 SVG**: Resolution-independent vector graphics.
